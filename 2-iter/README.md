# Iter 2 - 19/11/2017

Alright, I'm back! I didn't abandon this project after the first session. That's a relief... Let's see how long I
can keep it up.

The first iteration was a bit of a bummer. I hit the difficulty wall right away, that's where the challenge is.
I also think my expectations for results were a bit high. In Numer.ai there's barely any signal to hang on to,
so it's all about fighting for those decimal points. I should think smaller.

My main conclusion was that I'm never going to beat originality with individual out-of-the-box models and I wasn't
learning anything specific from playing with them anyways, so why bother. I want to really commit to the AutoML
approach. I don't have time to do deep feature engineering and try different ensemble permuations, but I can
be smart and let the computer do the dirty work. Getting into AutoML is also a learning goal for me, so might
as well.

## Goals

* When I say AutoML a few tools come into mind, but I want to do a proper review of what is available at the moment.

* I want to run a few initial AutoML experiments. I don't expect to get much done in this iteration apart from 
research though.

* Add comparison to -ln(0.5) as well as baseline.
